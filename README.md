### About the name

Sticking with the typical boating metaphors, at first I thought
"cockpit" or "cabin" might be suitable, but those were already taken.
Since we operate in the cloud anyway, I chose the airship equivalent...

From [Airship
Advocate](https://airshipadvocate.com/information/glossary-of-dirigible-terms/):

> **Gondola** â€“ This is a compartment that holds passengers, crew, and/or
> equipment and is located beneath a balloon or airship.
